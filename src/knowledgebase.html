        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          High quality documentation is an important cornerstone of any software
          product, particularly if the product contains some complex workflows.
          Having easily accessible, well maintained and structured documentation
          provides some key benefits to a business including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Quicker onboarding for new users</li>
          <li>Seamless learning experiences and reduction in learning curve</li>
          <li>Increased trust in the company</li>
          <li>Competitive advantage</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ultimately if users feel confident that they can use a product, they
          are more likely to be advocates and it dramatically reduces support
          and training calls. When a user feels confident that they know how to
          use a product, satisfaction increases, as does their performance. That
          was the objective when creating the itris Knowledgebase but it did not
          come without it's challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          I led the design and collaborated with key stakeholders from across
          the business to produce a high-quality learning resource for the
          company and the users of the product.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          At the time, documentation existed as PDFs on a shared drive. Users
          did have access to these documents, but they were often difficult to
          find for users as well as itris staff. As a result, documents were
          often duplicated and changed to align more closely with the department
          consuming them which led to scattered documentation that was quickly
          out of date.
        </p>
        <p>
          This gave rise to an increasing amount of inconsistency for users as
          there was not an easily accessible, central source of truth for
          learning materials. Additionally, the training team was also offering
          training courses but these were big commitments from customers and
          proved to be inefficient for an industry that typically have high
          staff turnover.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was something that needed to be addressed as it was becoming an
          issue for the business and leading to users not getting the expected
          level of service they expected. It was also not meeting the standards
          of quality set by the business.
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <div class="goals">
          <div class="user-goals">
            <h3>User</h3>

                pace in their preferred method

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          I looked into options of using an off-the-shelf solution to
          documentation and researched products like GitBook and Notion, but
          they lacked the customisability that we needed. I also looked into
          whether we could expose our Confluence articles publicly, but this
          came with too many trade-offs and again, a lack of customisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then looked at some best-in-class documentation for some inspiration
          and found myself drawn to Stripe Guides in particular. I also looked
          at Apple's support docs as well as Atlassian's documentation.
        </p>

        <h2>Opportunity</h2>
        <p>
          Since none of the off-the-shelf solutions were viable, I explored the
          idea of creating our own purpose-built site that catered for the
          different learning journeys for a user and somewhere users could also
          find top tips, FAQs and product release notes.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            All of the learning materials were currently in PDFs and our
            internal docs platform so these would need to be ported over to the
            site (which was in markdown format)
          </li>
          <li>
            A new iteration of our visual language was in progress but it was
            immature so implementing this would add to the scope as new
            components would need to be created specifically for the
            knowledgebase
          </li>
          <li>
            The training team would need to learn and become familiar with VS
            Code, writing articles in markdown and have a base understanding of
            git version control.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          I spent some time exploring different designs and after many different
          routes and meetings with stakeholders, I settled on a final version of
          the designs. Throughout the ideation phase, it was important to ensure
          that the design <em>felt right</em> and was aligned with the brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final product contained a landing page, articles accessible
          through a series route (mirroring training courses) or categories
          route, search capabilities, release notes, top tips and FAQs.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 56px">Results</h2>
        <p>
          The knowledgebase was a success and received positive feedback from
          users and stakeholders (and even a competitor). Since its release in
          2022, there are 200+ articles on the site, as well as 50+ top tips and
          60+ FAQs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monthly traffic to the knowledgebase is X and the number of training
          and support enquiries has dropped by nearly 50%.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          As a result of the knowledgebase, the demands on our services changed
          and the volume of inbound calls and emails reduced considerably. We
          were also able to reduce the training function's headcount from 5
          members of staff down to 1, whilst still maintaining strong customer
          feedback.
