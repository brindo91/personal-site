        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          The recruitment industry is a numbers-driven and KPIs play a critical
          role in measuring individual, team, and organisational performance.
          For recruiters, these metrics influence promotions, pay reviews, and
          commissions, making them a powerful motivator. For a business, these
          metrics indicate aspects like profitability and efficiency. By
          providing clarity and focus on targets, KPIs help individuals
          understand expectations, driving both personal and business success.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          While some data <em>was</em> available in itris, it was scattered
          across different areas of the product, making it difficult to access
          and track. There was also no way to record targets against any
          metrics, nor was there a dedicated space for users to monitor
          performance metrics efficiently. This led to frustration and
          inefficiencies and as a result, users had to rely on workarounds, such
          as exporting multiple reports and manipulating them in spreadsheets
          which was time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          This inefficiency and missing of target options on metrics had a
          direct business impact, contributing to churn, lost deals, and
          ultimately revenue risk. The gap was up to $1.7m in lost annual
          revenue.
        </p>

        <div class="goals">
          <div class="user-goals">

            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          We had a good amount of feedback on this problem already which came
          primarily from speaking to customers and other feedback streams, but
          also from the sales team. In addition, I analysed some competitors as
          well as similar stand-alone tools in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provided a good amount of insight, but I had some knowledge gaps
          that I wanted to fill and assumptions to validate so I also conducted
          a survey to customers to dig a little deeper into some of the key
          themes identified initially. The results of the survey provided some
          clarity including:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 6px">
          <li>Nearly a third of respondents set collective KPIs</li>
          <li>
            Weekly KPIs were the most popular, with monthly KPIs a close second
          </li>
          <li>
            The importance of being able to drill down into the KPI data was
            rated 92%
          </li>
          <li>
            Most respondents were exporting reports to Excel to track KPIs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="banner">
          <div class="banner-icon insight-icon">ðŸ’¡</div>
          <div class="banner-content">
            <div class="banner-header">Key insight</div>
            <div class="banner-text">
              <p>
                Historically, we understood KPIs to be <i>target-based</i>, but
                I recognised an interesting pattern in the survey and I was keen
                to pull on the thread. After following up with some respondents,
                my suspicions were confirmed that some KPIs were set without
                specific targets. This became a key insight, and one we wouldn't
                have considered in the initial scope without speaking to
                customers.

          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Once the research phase was complete, I collaborated with the
          development, product and QA teams to outline the initial scope for the
          project. The scope consisted of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a total of 25 configurable metrics to track</li>
          <li>granular configurability for nuanced metrics</li>
          <li>historical tracking and auditing when targets are updated</li>
          <li>a dashboard for users to keep track of their performance</li>
          <li>drill down capabilities to dig deeper into the data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          KPIs would be configurable in the settings area and would be tied to a
          user, team or the whole organisation (i.e. all users).
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/configuration.png"
            alt="Settings area where KPIs are configured and managed"
            class="article-content__image--app lightbox-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Table view of configured KPIs</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/new-kpi.png"
            alt="Image of a modal for creating new KPIs"
            class="article-content__image--app lightbox-image sunken-image__new-kpi"
          />
          <figcaption>Modal to create a new KPI</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          It was also crucial that KPIs were communicated to the user well.
          After many iterations of the KPI card, I settled on a final design
          that struck the right balance between information density and visual
          weight.
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/kpi-anatomy.png"
            alt="KPI widget card anatomy"
            class="article-content__image lightbox-image sunken-image"
          />
          <figcaption>KPI widget card anatomy in hover state</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          The KPI cards were then displayed in a dedicated dashboard for the
          user so that they could have a single source of truth for their
          individual performance as well as their contributions to team and
          organisational metrics.
        </p>

        <figure class="article-content__figure">
          <img
            src="/assets/images/dashboard.png"
            alt="KPI dashboard"
            class="article-content__image lightbox-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Final dashboard design to visualise KPIs</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Users can also drill down into the data behind the KPIs to see the
          activity that contributed to the metric. This slides out a panel to
          the side to reveal the data where users can export the data or convert
          it to a search.
        </p>

            alt="Drill down panel"
            class="article-content__image lightbox-image"
          />
          <figcaption>Dashboard with drill down panel open</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>
          This project was a great example of collaboration between the product,
          development and QA teams. Unfortunately, I don't have any numbers to
          share on the impact of this project, but I am confident that, given
          the revenue risk, this project has had a positive impact and has
          increased chance of winning deals, retaining customers and reducing
          churn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also learned a lot about the importance of KPIs and metrics in the
          recruitment industry. In hindsight, I would have liked to have spent
          more time refining the components in the KPI configuration modal to
          see if it could benefit from a progressive disclosure pattern instead.
          Due to time constraints and development cost, implementing this
          pattern was outside of the scope. I would also have liked to have
          explored how AI could help provide insights to recruiters on
          strategies for improving their KPIs.
        </p>

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
          KPIs in recruitment is a vast field with a lot of potential for future
          improvements. Future considerations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>More metrics</li>
          <li>Private KPIs</li>
          <li>Projections</li>
          <li>Comparisons</li>
          <li>Composite KPIs</li>
        </ul>
