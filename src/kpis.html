        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          Recruitment is a numbers-driven industry, where KPIs play a critical
          role in measuring individual, team, and organisational performance.
          These metrics influence promotions, pay reviews, and commissions,
          making them a powerful motivator. By providing clarity and focus on
          targets, KPIs help individuals understand expectations, driving both
          personal and business success.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          While KPI data <em>was available</em>, it was scattered across
          different areas of the product, making it difficult to access and
          track. There was no dedicated space for users to monitor performance
          metrics efficiently, leading to frustration and inefficiencies. As a
          result, users had to rely on workarounds, such as exporting multiple
          reports and manually compiling them in spreadsheetsâ€”an error-prone and
          time-consuming process.
        </p>
        <p>
          This inefficiency had a direct business impact, increasing customer
          frustration, contributing to churn, lost deals, and revenue risk. The
          lack of an integrated KPI solution left a potential revenue gap of up
          to Â£720k ($930k) ARRâ€”nearly $1M in lost annual revenue.
        </p>
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <h3>User Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove user frustration</li>
          <li>Provide an efficient and flexible way to track metrics</li>
          <li>Users should be able to drill down into KPIs</li>
          <li>Metrics should be visually clear and detailed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Business Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect revenue</li>
          <li>Reduce the risk of customer churn</li>
          <li>Increase stickiness for customers</li>
          <li>Remove barriers for sales</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
          We had a good amount of feedback on this problem already which came
          primarily from speaking to customers and async feedback, but also from
          the sales team. In addition, I analysed some competitors as well as
          similar stand-alone tools in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          This provided a good amount of insight, but I had some gaps in
          knowledge and assumptions to validate so we also conducted a survey to
          customers to dig a little deeper into some of the key themes
          identified initially. The results of the survey provided some clarity.
        </p>

            <div class="banner-text">
              <p>
                Some of the highlighted insights gathered from research were:
              </p>
              <ul style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 6px">
                <li>Collective KPIs made up nearly a third of the split</li>
                <li>Weekly KPIs were the most popular</li>
                <li>
                  The importance of being able to drill downs into KPIs was
                  rated 92%
                </li>
                <li>
                  Most respondents were exporting reports to excel to track KPIs
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Once the research phase was complete, I collaborated with the
          engineering, product and QA teams to outline the initial scope for the
          project. The scope consisted of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a total of 25 configurable metrics to track</li>
          <li>granular configurability for nuanced metrics</li>
          <li>historical tracking and auditing when targets are updated</li>
          <li>a dashboard for users to keep track of their performance</li>
          <li>drill down capabilities to dig deeper into the data</li>
          <li>
            a report for managers business leaders to report on performance
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For users, KPIs should be represented in a clear way and have the
          ability to drill down and report on any metric to see the activity
          that contributed to the metric.

        <p>
          It was also crucial that KPIs were communicated to the user well.
          After many iterations of the KPI card, I settled on a final design
          that struck the right balance between information density and visual
          weight.

        <h2>Future</h2>
        <p>
