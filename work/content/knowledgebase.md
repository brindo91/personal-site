# KPIs

- Made redundant before release
- Ask Ian to provide stats (revenue gap)
- Ask Adam to export all KPI specs from confluence - I need the research one.

## Project Overview

Frame this one as an opportunity for the business, not necessarily a problem.

### Research

We released a survey that included a survey to collect information from respondents on what they would ideally see in KPIs.
Also competitor anlysis and feedback from users through suggestions.
Identified 25 metrics that we could cater for but we wanted to seek additional ones from customers and gauge interest in each of them. In the end we had just under 40 metrics.

Key take-aways from research:

- We didn't consider that people might want targetless KPIs to just track figures
- Ratios were popular, but not that popular

## The Challenge

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam euismod, nisl eget aliquam ultricies, nunc nisl aliquet nunc, quis aliquam nisl nunc quis nisl.

## The Solution

Our approach included:

1. Research and discovery
2. User experience design
3. Visual design
4. Development and testing

## Results

- Increased conversion rate by 25%
- Reduced bounce rate by 15%
- Improved user satisfaction scores

# Portfolio

## My personal website and portfolio

- A portfolio should be a sales tool. I need to sell myself!
- Showcase the _why_ on case studies / showcases, not just the _how and what_
- I should be myself, not sound like everyone else
- Don't approach it from the point of view of it should be what the hiring managers want to hear
- Text hierarchy and formatting is crucial
- Focus on my value prop and personal story (in the about, talk about why I am a product designer and where it started…)
- Use philosophy degree to my advantage and explain how that helps me
- Tell my story
- I’m versatile, reliable / dependable,

Years of experience - "Since 2014" or "over 10+ years experience"?

I really like components and design systems.

I'm always looking of new and interesting ways to close that gap between design and engineering. I have been comfortable with HTML and CSS for a while now, but for web development JavaScript has always been the foreboding Goliath staring at me from the corner. Recently, I decided to take on this Goliath and begin learning JavaScript and I wish I had done so sooner. I want to learn more like React, Tailwind, Postgres, possibly Node.js and all the while I want to really learn more about CSS because there are so many exciting new things being added that really call to me.

What's my point of view on design?

Writing / blog:

- Compliance - temp market is huge (opportunity) and heavily reliant on compliance - after releasing multiple iterations, we managed to sign up _how many customers_ with revenue increase of _£xxx_?
- Org chart
- Form builder - gap identified
- Velocity components -> Demonstrate Knowledgebase and Auth Portal
- Tokens / variables -> Streamlined designer workflow and developer handoff (style dictionary and storybook)
- Being made redundant
- Learning to code

Case studies:

- Give a very brief overview (TL;DR) of the project up-front with a link to another page that has the comprehensive version. Don't give everything away though - save some for the interview.
- 2-3 case studies with one that can be clicked to go deeper.
- 1 case study should have 3 different versions - TL;DR, medium, full
- Consider this as the free sample to your menu of work - keep it short and sweet and save the meat for the interview and portfolio presentation.

Showcases instead of case study:

- Highlight problem or opportunity
- Show solution - high fidelity
- Impact - success metric, business / customer impact
- Showcase a business problem AND a user problem
